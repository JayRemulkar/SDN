PRACTICAL 3

Information:

1.	SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) is sometimes called port mirroring or port monitoring, it selects network traffic for analysis by a network analyzer. SPAN is Switch Specific tools that Copies ethernet frames passing through switch parts and send these frames out to Specific port.
2.	SNMP protocol allows to remote monitor & control network devices. Syslog is just an alerting mechanism - it won't allow to remotely take action when an alarm happens. syslog in often used for troubleshooting & debugging while SNMP messages are used for device management and reporting.
3.	CISCO IOS Flexible Netflow is the next generation in flow technology. It Optimizes the network infrastructure reducing Operation costs and improving Capacity planning and Security Incident detection with increased flexibility & Scalability. It helps to Customize traffic identification. Ability to focus & monitor a wider information range. Enhanced network anomaly and security detection.

STEPS:
A)	Implement span technology
Step 1: (Required Resources) 
1) Take 2 Machines and named them as PC-1 & PC-2
 2) Now take 1 Switch of 2960 and name it as S1.
Step 2:
1) Now Connect PCI to Switch S with Fast Ethernet 0 cable to Fast Ethernet 0/1 Cable.
 2) Now connect switch S1, to PC-2 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 cable to Fast Ethernet 0.
(Wait for few seconds it will turn into green light)
Step 3:
 Click on Switch S1 and go to the CLI Commands and Configure the Switch S1

B) Implement SNMP & syslog
Step 1:
1) Take 1 Machine and give name PC-1 to it
2) Then take 1 Switch of 2960 and give name S1 to it. 
3) Take 2 Routers of 1841 and name them R1 and R2

Step 2:
1) Connect PC-1 to switch S1 with Fast Ethernet 0 to Fast Ethernet 0/1 cable. 
2) Then Connect switch S1 to Router R1 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet 0/0 cable.
3) When Connect switch S1 to Router R2 with Fast Ethernet 0/3 to Fast Ethernet 0/0 cable. (Wait for few seconds it will turn into green light.) 
Step 3
1) Now click on device PC-1 go to desktop click on IP ConFIg and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it 
2) click on R1 go to Config and select the Fast Ethernet 0, After that add the IP Address and Subnet Mask to it and turn it ON 
3) Same Goes for router R2
STEP 4
1) After configuring the connection between the router and switches, take packet and try to make it flow 
2) Then click on R1 and go to the CLI Commands and configure the router R1

C Implement flexible NetFlow
Step 1:
1) Let us take 1 Server and name it as Server1. 
2) Take 1 router of 1841 and give name R1 to it
3) Take 1 switch of 2960 and give name S1 to it 
4) Take 1 machine and name it as PC-1
Step 2:
1) Now let we connect those networks with dotted crossover line.
 2) First Server1 connect to router R1 with Fast Ethernet 0/0 to Fast Ethernet 0/0 cable. 
3) Then connect router R1 to switch S1 with cable Fast Ethernet 0/1 to Fast
4) Then connect switch S1 to PC-1 with Fast Ethernet 0/2 to Fast Ethernet cable
(Wait for few seconds it will turn into green light.)
Step 3:
1) Now click on PC-1 go to the desktop and click on IP Config and add IP Address and subnet mask to it. 
2) Click on R1 go to Config and select the Fast Ethernet 0/0 cable, after that add the IP Address and Subnet mask to it and turn it ON.
3) Then click on server1 go to the desktop and add IPv4 Address and Subnet Mask to it.
4) Click on R1 go to Config and select the Fast Ethernet 0/1, after that add IPv4 Address and Subnet mask to it and turn it ON.
 5) Then click on R1 and go to the CLI Commands and configure the router
 (After Configuring the connection between the server1 and PC-1 take a packet and try to make it flow.)
