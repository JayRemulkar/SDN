Prac 10 ipsec

Info:
To Connect destinations with same IP network address or for low-level network segregation on Single hardware platform, VRF (VRF-like) is used.
IPSec is Collection of protocols that provide encryption for Sensitive data & ensure end-to-end integrity of data.
Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) was developed when Security was not primary Concern therefore GRE tunnels are often secured with Ipsec Encryption.
2 ways to implement encryption over GRE tunnel is: 
Crypto maps & Tunnel IPsec profile.
IPsec site-to-Site VPNs
 can only Send Unicast IP traffic so they don't Support routing protocols. that require multicast/broadcast communication
 GRE
 is a VPN tunneling technology that permits Unicast, multicast & broadcast traffic. GRE does not encrypt traffic.
 GRE over IPsec provides Security & Support for routing protocols.


Steps:
Step 1: (Required Resources)
1)	Take 3 Routers of 1941 and name them as R1, R2 and R3
2)	Take 3 Switches of 2960-24TT and name them as $1, $2 and $3. 
3)	Take 3 Machine of PC-PT and name them PCA, PC-B and PC-C
Step 2: 
Now connect router R1 to router R2 with serial cable 0/0/0 to serial able 00/1. And also connect Router R2 to router R3 with serial cable 0/0/1 to serial cable 0/0/0 
Step 3:
 Lets connect PC-A to switch S1 with Fast Ethernet0 to Fast Ethernet0/1 cable Now connect switch S1 to router R1 with Fast Ethernet0/2 to Fast Ehemet0/0 cable
Step 4: 
Now connect PC-B to Switch S2 with Fast Ethernet0 to Fast Ethernet0/1
cable. And also connect switch S2 to router R2 with Fast Ethernet0/2 to Fast Ethernet0/0

Step 5:
 Now connect router R3 to switch $3 with Fast EthernetFa0/0 to Fast Ethernet0/2 cable. And also connect Switch S3 to PC-C with Fast Ethernet0/1 to Fast Ethernet0 cable.
