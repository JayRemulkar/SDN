PRAC 6 Observe STP Topology changes and Implement PSTP Implement Advanced SIP Mediation.ond Mechanisms Implement MST

INFO:
•	STP (Spanning TRee protocol is predominantly used to prevent layer 2 loops and broadcast Storms and so used for network redundancy. It was developed around the time where recovery from an outage that took upwards of a minute by more was acceptable. Stp is used to prevent looping within a network Topology. It avoids problems that arise when Computers exchange data on a LAN that Contains redundant path.
•	RSTP is a set of rules by which Switches on the network determine the best way to route data on network without redundancy. 
•	MST (Multiple Spanning Tree) was created to allow multi spanning tree topologies while preserving Scalability. Mst(MULTIPLE SPANNING TREE) enables an admin to map an arbitrary no. of VLANS to Single MST instance, resulting in the minimum no. of instances needed to satisfy a design.


Steps:
Step 1: (Requirement)
1) Take 2 Multiport Switch of 3550 name them as D1 and D2 
2) Then take 1 normal Switch of 2960 and name it as A1

Step 2:
1) Now connect D1 to D2 with Giga Ethernet 1/0/1 to Giga Ethernet 10/1 
2) Now connect D1 to A1 with Giga Ethernet 1/0/5 to Fast Ethernet 0/1 cable.
3) Once Again make same connection between D1 to A1 just for backup with Giga Ethernet 1/0/6 to Fast Ethernet 0/2
Step 3:
1) Now connect D2 to A1 with Giga Ethernet 1/0/5 to Fast Ethernet 0/3 cable.
2) Once Again make same connection between D2 to A1 just for backup with Giga Ethernet 1/0/6 to Fast Ethernet 0/4
Step 4:
1) Now Double click on D1, go to the physical and there you will find Power Switch Just Drag that switch in Physical Device and close window 
2) Now Double click on D2, go to the physical and there you will find Power Switch Just Drag that switch in Physical Device and close window
Step 5:
 Click on D1 and go to the CLI command and Configure and add IP Address to the multiport switch D1.

Step 6: 
Click on D2 and go to the CLI command and Configure and add IP Address to the multiport switch D2. Step 7: Click on A1 and go to the CLI command and Configure and add IP Address to the switch A1.
