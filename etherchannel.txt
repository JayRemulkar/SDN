Prac 7 etherchannel
Info:


Etherchannel is a port link aggregation technology Lor part-channel architecture used primarily on cisco Switches. It allows grouping of several physical Ethernet links to create one logical Ethernet link for the purpose of providing fault-tolerance and high speed links between Switches, routers and Secves.
LACP (link Aggregation Control protocol) maintains EtherChannel Bundles (8 active & 8standby members). Load Balancing method in Ether channel is global Settings on the Switch.
 Ether channel is used to provide fault tolerance, load sharing, increased bandwidth and redundancy between Switches, routers and Servers.

Steps:
Step 1: (Requirement)
Take 3 Switches of 2960 and name it as S1, S2 and S3.

Step 2: 
Configure the basic Switch setting
1) Now connect switch S1 to $2 with Giga Ethernet 0/1 to Giga Ethernet 0/1 cable
 2) Once again Connect switch $1 to $2 with Giga Ethernet 0/2 to Giga Ethernet 0/2 cable.
 3) Then Connect $1 to $3 with Fast Ethernet 0/21 to Fast Ethernet 0/21 cable.
4) Once again Connect $1 to $2 with Fast Ethernet 0/22 to Fast Ethernet 0/22 cable. 
5) Then Connect S2 to 53 with Fast Ethernet 0/23 to Fast Ethernet 0/23 cable 
6) Once again Connect $2 to 53 with Fast Ethernet 0/24 to Fast Ethernet 0/24 cable.

Step 3:
1) Click on S1 and go to CLI command and Configure the Switch $1. 
2) Similarly Configure the Switch $2 and Switch $3.
