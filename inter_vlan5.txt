PRACTICAL 5

INFO:

Inter-VLAN routing is the ability to route or send traffic between VLANs  that are normally blocked by default . Switches and VIANS work at MAC address layer(Layer 2)
Traffic can't be routed between VLANs at Layer2 based on MAC addresses .
Inter-VLAN routing enables routers or layer3 Switch to route traffic between VIANS
As network use case is common, network admins need to understand inter-VLAN routing. Inter VLAN routing is process of forwarding network traffic from one VIAN to another VLAN 
3 inter VLAN routing Options:
•	Legacy Inter VLAN routing 
•	Router-on-a-stick
•	Layer 3 Switch using switched virtual interfaces (SVIs)


Steps:
Step 1:(Required Resources)
1) Take 1 Router of and give name R1 to it 
2) Now take 2 Switches of 2960 and give name S1 and S2 to them 
3) And last take 2 Machines and give name PC-A and PC-B to them Step 2:
STEP2:
1) Now connect router R1 to switch S1 with Fast Ethernet tar cable to Fast Ethernet 10/1 cable.
 2) Now connect switch $1 to switch $2 with Fast Ethernet fa0/2 cable to Fast Ethernet 10/1 cable.
 3) Now connect switch S1 to PC-A with Fast Ethernet fa0/3 cable to Fast Ethernet fa0 cable. 
4) Now connect switch S2 to PC-B with Fast Ethernet fa0/2 cable to Fast Ethernet fa0 cable.

Step 3:

1) Now click on device PC-A, go to Desktop click on IP Config and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it. 
2) Now click on device PC-B, go to Desktop click on IP Config and add IP Address and Subnet mask to it

Step 4: 
Click on switch S1 and go to CLI commands and Configure the switch S1 and add IP Address and subnet mask to it. 
Step 5: 
Click on switch S2 and go to CLI commands and Configure the switch S2 and add IP Address and subnet mask to it.

Step 6: 
Click on router R1 and go to CLI commands and Configure the router R1 and add IP Address and subnet mask to it.
